# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Advanced Notification Fields
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for additional FCM fields like icon, sound, and click action.
# Details:
1. Update node properties to include fields for icon, sound, and click action
2. Modify the message construction logic to include these fields when provided
3. Update both structured and JSON modes to support these fields

Example implementation:
```typescript
// ... (inside execute method)
const icon = this.getNodeParameter('icon', 0) as string;
const sound = this.getNodeParameter('sound', 0) as string;
const clickAction = this.getNodeParameter('clickAction', 0) as string;

const notification: messaging.Notification = {
  title,
  body,
  icon: icon || undefined,
};

const android: messaging.AndroidConfig = {
  notification: {
    sound: sound || undefined,
    clickAction: clickAction || undefined,
  },
};

const message: messaging.Message = {
  token, // or topic, or condition
  notification,
  android,
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for advanced notification fields
2. Test sending messages with various combinations of advanced fields
3. Verify that the fields are correctly included in the FCM payload
4. Perform integration testing to ensure advanced fields work as expected on target devices
