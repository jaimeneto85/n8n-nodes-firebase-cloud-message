			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks such as initializing the npm package, installing dependencies, configuring TypeScript, setting up the folder structure, and configuring package.json for n8n custom node compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "While foundational, this task involves several discrete steps that are standard for TypeScript/npm projects and n8n custom node development. Each step is straightforward but necessary for a robust setup, and splitting them helps ensure nothing is missed[1][4][5]."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement OAuth2 Authentication Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for creating the credentials file, implementing the OAuth2 logic, adding helper functions for parsing/validation, and implementing token generation/refresh logic.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing authentication with OAuth2 and service account JSON involves understanding both n8n credential structures and Firebase authentication flows. Parsing, validation, and token management add moderate complexity[1][2]."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Basic Node Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for creating the node file, defining node metadata, creating the icon, and adding the operation selection property.",
			"reasoning": "Defining the node structure and metadata is essential for n8n custom nodes. While not deeply complex, it requires attention to n8n conventions and UI integration[1][4][5]."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Firebase Initialization Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for creating the initialization helper, integrating it into the execute method, and adding error handling for initialization failures.",
			"reasoning": "Initializing Firebase with dynamic credentials and handling singleton app instances requires careful error handling and understanding of the Firebase Admin SDK lifecycle."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Token-based Message Sending",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for adding token-based properties, notification content fields, implementing single token sending, implementing multiple token sending, and handling results/errors.",
			"reasoning": "Sending messages to device tokens involves multiple input scenarios, message construction, and robust error handling, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Topic and Condition-based Messaging",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for adding topic operation, adding condition operation, implementing topic-based sending, and implementing condition-based sending.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple message routing strategies (topic, condition) adds branching logic and requires careful parameter handling and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Notification Options",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for adding advanced options to the UI, updating message construction logic, handling Android-specific options, handling iOS-specific options, and supporting custom data fields.",
			"reasoning": "Advanced options require deep integration with FCM payload structures, platform-specific logic, and flexible UI/parameter handling, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement JSON Mode for Message Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for adding the JSON mode toggle, implementing the JSON input field, updating the execute method to handle JSON mode, and adding error handling for invalid JSON.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting both structured and raw JSON configuration introduces conditional logic, parsing, and error handling, but leverages existing message sending logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Validation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing input validation functions, integrating validation into the execute method, adding comprehensive error handling, handling Firebase-specific errors, and supporting continue-on-fail logic.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive validation and error handling is critical for reliability and user experience, requiring careful coverage of all input and runtime scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Package Publishing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for writing the README, creating example workflows, updating package.json metadata, creating a changelog, adding a license, and preparing build/publish scripts.",
			"reasoning": "While not technically complex, this task is multi-faceted and essential for usability and distribution, requiring attention to detail and completeness[1][5]."
